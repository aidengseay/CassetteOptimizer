# Cassette Optimizer

## Overview
This project is taking a Spotify playlist and optimizing the best fit for a cassette.

## Input Specifications
A Python file will take data from Spotify via an API. This will take song data from a
playlist. We will worry about collecting the song title, artist, and song duration.
The input data from Spotify will be formatted into a text file for the C program to use and
perform the necessary operations

## Optimization Specifications
The program is given a list of songs. It is required to find the best fit. When saying the best fit
it needs to fit the most number of songs on two 45-minute playlists (45-minutes is the most common size of
a blank cassette).
